# Fix some iso3 IDs that are wrong in ne_10m_admin_0_countries_lakes.shp,
# ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces_lakes.shp seems ok though.
#
# Not all the ADM0_A3 IDs match those used in the ISO_A3 standard. This script replaces non-matching IDs
# with corresponding ISO_A3 values. For more details see issue #12 https://github.com/yaph/d3-geomap/issues/12.
